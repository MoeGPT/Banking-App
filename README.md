## Getting Started
This is a basic banking app that allows users to create or sign in to an account. Afterwards, they will be able to do various banking transactions such as withdrawals, transfers, deposits, and view their balance. 
This program currently does not use UI elements and is a terminal-only test case to practice Java development. Â

## Project Documentation
This is where I will state my thoughts and plans for this project so that a timeline will exist, and you can understand my thoughts and coding process better. 
### July 30, 2025
Today, I plan to finish adding all the set methods for account variables(added city variable for a more precise address). I will focus mostly on developing the routing and account numbers section of the sign-up module. 
Routing and Account numbers should be: Unique, Randomly generated, and linked to an Account.
To ensure the numbers are unique during the sign-up process, I can iterate through all made accounts and check those account numbers against the newly generated ones. This seems like the simplest and straightforward method.
If I complete the above part relatively quickly, I will also create return methods for all variables in the account class. 

**Update from later on July 30th**
Account and routing numbers should be unique and are only assiged to an account when both values are unique.
