## Getting Started
This is a basic banking app that allows users to create or sign in to an account. Afterwards, they will be able to do various banking transactions such as withdrawals, transfers, deposits, and view their balance. 
This program currently does not use UI elements and is a terminal-only test case to practice Java development. Â

## Project Documentation
This is where I will state my thoughts and plans for this project so that a timeline will exist, and you can understand my thoughts and coding process better. 
### July 30, 2025 ###
Today, I plan to finish adding all the set methods for account variables(added city variable for a more precise address). I will focus mostly on developing the routing and account numbers section of the sign-up module. 
Routing and Account numbers should be: Unique, Randomly generated, and linked to an Account.
To ensure the numbers are unique during the sign-up process, I can iterate through all made accounts and check those account numbers against the newly generated ones. This seems like the simplest and straightforward method.
If I complete the above part relatively quickly, I will also create return methods for all variables in the account class. 

**Update from later on July 30th**
Account and routing numbers should be unique and are only assiged to an account when both values are unique.

### August 4, 2025 ###
Happy Monday! Today, I plan to finish the address section of the sign-up process. It will have basic verification
to ensure the address is in the correct format; however, it will not check if the address actually exists, similar to
the email address section. Furthermore, it will not include the optional address line 2 field for apartments, suites, and other locations.
This is mainly because I do not plan to add any function that requires the account holder's specific location. 
If this is done with relative ease, I will work on the log-in section and the general main part of the program. 

**Update from later on August 4th**
I have finished the account creation process. I also added login and main menu functionality where a user can view info,
withdraw, and deposit funds. This was the main purpose of the program. So, I currently do not know if I plan to update this
program to incorporate UI elements or real-world applications. I'm still considering the skills I can develop from that 
or if I should invest time developing skills in other technologies like React and Javascript.
