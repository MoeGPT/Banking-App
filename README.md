## Getting Started
This is a basic banking app that allows users to create or sign in to an account. Afterwards, they will be able to do various banking transactions such as withdrawals, transfers, deposits, and view their balance. 
This program currently does not use UI elements and is a terminal-only test case to practice Java development. Â
