## Getting Started
This is a basic banking app that allows users to create or sign in to an account. Afterwards, they will be able to do various banking transactions such as withdrawals, transfers, deposits, and view their balance. 
This program currently does not use UI elements and is a terminal-only test case to practice Java development. Â

## Updates
Update 0.12
Added input validation for creating an account. Variables affected: (First Name, Last Name, Email, Username, Password)
Usernames are written to a file and this file is read to ensure username is unique
Security flaw - The text file can be edited which can cause issues client-side issues. Most likely a permeant flaw because this is a test application.
Next update I plan to finish the acoount creation section (Home address and Banking info). Account and Routing Numbers will be unique to individuals accounts and input validation for home address should also be completed.
